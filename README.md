# Creating Coding

Miscellaneous experiments in generating moving art/visuals.

This code is going to be pretty rough around the edges, as this
is a fun project I do in my spare time. That said, I always
welcome suggestions and feedback!

I've done my best to credit sources; if there are any omissions,
I apologize. Please file an issue and I'll address it.
